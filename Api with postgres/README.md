# Storefront Backend Project

## Table of Contents

This project is a back end for a storefront with the databses, connection and the most of error handling


## How it was made 

This project is made by setting up databases for 
users [to have the information of users (id,Email,Username,FirstName,LastName,HashedPassword)],
products[To have the products (Name,Product_Descrip,Price)],
orders[To have the orders (id,status,Userid)],
Order products[To have the products of orders (id,Quantity,OrderId)],

By using different HTTP Request Method you can add and edit in every database defined at 
-[Endpoints](#Endpoints-to-be-accessed)

## Tests made
The server got logger middleware to give the ip,api visited,status,and the time taken in ms.
   # It test during runtime
    if the {user,product,order] found in the databse before editing its info.
    if the order is found before adding products to it .
    
## How to use

  # Ports
  Database port:5432
  Port to access the backend: 3000
  localhost:3000

  # Setup:
  `config.ts` contain all the configration for environmental variables.
  You have to create `.env` file with all the required enironment variables:
  ```bash
  # .env
  PORT=3000
  NODE_ENV=dev
  # Database connection information
  POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
  POSTGRES_PORT=5432
  POSTGRES_DB=store_dev
  POSTGRES_DB_TEST=store_test
  POSTGRES_USER=store_admin
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD=123456
  #User password
  BCRYPT_PASSWORD=your-secert-password
  SALT_ROUNDS=10
  TOKEN_SECRET=your-secret-token
  ```

  ### Creating the database
  ``psql
  #Connect to the defaullt postgres database as the root user
    `psql -U postgres`
    - In psql create a user
    `CREATE USER store_admin WITH PASSWORD '123456';`
    - In psql create dev and test databses
    `CREATE DATABASE store_dev;`
    `CREATE DATABASE store_test;`
  ##Connect to the databses and grant all privileges
    - Grant for dev database
    `\c store_dev`
    `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE store_dev TO store_admin;`
    - Grant for test database
    `\c store_test`
    `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE store_test TO store_admin;`
  ###Run the migration command in terminal
    - npm run migration:run
  ####Start the server 
  -npm run start
  -go to localhost:3000
  
  ``

  # scripts:
  npm run build:To build the project
  npm run start:To start the server on localhost.
  npm run dev: To devleop and run server.js .
  npm run fulltest: To do all the migrations required and test the endpoint and fuctions using jasmine in one code.
  npm run pretest: To reset the database and run all up migrations,and make the files ready to test.

  npm run lint :To use eslint to check coding error.
  ~
                 ([Note]:after building the project for the first time or after deleting the build folder the eslint code will give some formatting error so run lint:fix code to fix them).
  npm run lint:fix   :To fix any formatting errors.
